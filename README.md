# Codidact/Core
The core Codidact Q&amp;A software implementation.

## Huh?
Codidact is community-driven Q&A software: created, maintained, used, and run by the community, for the community. There's no
money-making company behind this.

We're currently in the early stages of development, but once we have a working MVP, we'll be hosting a public Codidact instance
for everyone to use. The software will also be available to download and run yourself to host your own instance under your own
rules.
